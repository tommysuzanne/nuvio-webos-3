> ## ⚠️ Unofficial modified build — legacy LG webOS
>
> **This is not the official Nuvio TV.** It is a modified fork, maintained by a
> third party, with one purpose: to keep Nuvio running on **LG TVs with webOS 4.x**
> (2018 and 2019 sets — C9, C8, B9, B8).
>
> **webOS 3.x and older are NOT supported**, and the app refuses to start there on
> purpose: the floor in `scripts/compatibilityPolicy.mjs` is webOS 4.0.0 /
> Chromium 53, while webOS 3.x ships Chromium 38 — a different engine that this
> build's output does not even parse. Supporting it would mean retargeting the
> bundle and widening the polyfill and CSS fallback sets, and I have no webOS 3.x
> set to verify against. If you own one and want to test, open an issue.
>
> Upstream Nuvio TV **0.3.42 requires webOS 5.0.0+ and Chromium 68+**, and its
> boot guard stops the app before it starts on anything older. On an OLED65C9
> (webOS 4.10.0, Chromium 53) the official build shows "TV not supported" and
> exits. This fork lowers that floor and supplies what the older engine and its
> Node 0.12 service runtime actually need.

> The manifest cache is upstream's, and it is a clear win — that row is why this

>
> ### Installing on an older LG
>
> Full step by step, including the graphical tool that avoids the command line
> entirely: **[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)**.
>
> Short version: turn on Developer Mode from the LG Content Store, install
> [webOS Dev Manager](https://github.com/webosbrew/dev-manager-desktop), add the TV
> (port `9922`, user `prisoner`, plus the passphrase the Dev Mode app shows), and
> install the `.ipk` from the Apps page.
>
> **The dev session expires** and the app stops launching until you extend it in
> the Developer Mode app. That is LG's restriction, and it is the most common
> reason a sideloaded app looks broken.
>
> ### Known state
>
> Verified on an OLED65C9 (webOS 4.10.0): home, search, detail, source list,
> playback including 4K, Dolby Vision from MP4 sources, audio and subtitle track
> menus naming the language, Trakt sync, watch progress and watched state.
>
> Limitations that are the platform, not the build: **Dolby Vision only engages
> from an MP4 container** — the same release in MKV plays as HDR10, which is why
> the source list ranks MP4 first and labels the container. Tested on exactly one
> model so far; reports from other webOS 4.x sets are welcome.
>
> ### Building and the release gates
>
> Building requires your own `local.properties` — copy
> `local.example.properties` and fill it in. Optional build flags:
> `NUVIO_UI_SCALE` (global UI scale, e.g. `0.8`), `NUVIO_BUILD_LABEL`,
> `NUVIO_IPK_NAME`.
>
> Three checks run in CI, and each one exists because the matching defect reached
> the TV without any build step noticing:
>
> | command                      | catches                                                                                            |
> | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | `npm run check:no-undef`     | identifier used and never declared — esbuild bundles it happily, `ReferenceError` fires at runtime |
> | `npm run check:legacy-regex` | post-ES2017 regex in `dist/`; a literal with an unsupported flag becomes `new RegExp(src, flags)`  |
> | `npm run check:legacy-css`   | fallback coverage report (informational — it exits 0 on purpose)                                   |
>
> The first one matters more than it sounds: `Router` catches a screen mount
> failure and downgrades it to `console.warn`, so an undeclared identifier in the
> home screen produced an **empty home with no visible error at all**.

## Get Nuvio TV

Nuvio TV supports **Samsung Tizen TVs from 2018 onward (Tizen 4+)** and **LG webOS TVs from 2020 onward (webOS 5+)**.
The startup compatibility baseline is Samsung Tizen 4.0 / Chromium 56 and LG webOS 5.0 / Chromium 68 when the platform reports those versions.

Platform capabilities are intentionally version-dependent:

- **Samsung Tizen 4.x** — the app and direct playback are supported, but torrent/P2P playback is unavailable by design. Some advanced audio and subtitle features may also be limited.
- **Samsung Tizen 5.x, including 5.5** — torrent/P2P playback is supported through the bundled local EngineFS service only. The PluginService, plugin execution, and remote plugin pull/push synchronization are disabled; the Plugins screen is not available.
  The Node 4.4.3 service runtime observed on Tizen 5.5 is incompatible with the current PluginService syntax and URL APIs. Experimental legacy transports are not included; plugin support starts at Tizen 6.0.
- **Samsung Tizen 6+** — torrent/P2P and the packaged PluginService are supported. Plugin execution requires the packaged service plus the TV runtime's Worker and WebAssembly support. Tizen 6 and later use the same current Tizen service pipeline.
- **LG webOS 5.x** — torrent/P2P and the packaged plugin service are supported, with the limited plugin resource quotas used by the older webOS runtime.
- **LG webOS 6+** — torrent/P2P and the packaged plugin service are supported with the modern plugin resource quotas.

On Tizen 5+ and LG webOS, torrent/P2P uses only the bundled local companion service; no external torrent streaming server is configured or required.

- [Nuvio TV Installer](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart/releases/latest) for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [Samsung Tizen WGT](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart/releases/latest) for manual installation
- [LG webOS Homebrew repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVWebOS/main/webosbrew/apps.json)
- [LG webOS IPK](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart/releases/latest) for manual installation

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTVSmart.git NuvioTVSmart
cd NuvioTVSmart
npm install
npm run build
```

Build TV packages with:

```bash
npm run package:tizen
npm run package:tizen:store
npm run package:webos
```

`package:tizen` creates the unsigned WGT used by development and the Nuvio TV Installer. The installer signs it locally for the target TV before installation. `package:tizen:store` is a separate Seller Office build: it requires Tizen Studio/Web CLI and a configured security profile, and creates the signed Store package with the local EngineFS service included so Tizen 5+ retains torrent/P2P playback. Tizen 4 still reports P2P as unsupported at runtime. Nuvio TV is built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and platform TV APIs. Building requires Node.js and npm; package installation additionally requires the relevant Tizen or webOS tools.
