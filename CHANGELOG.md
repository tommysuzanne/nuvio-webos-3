## 1.0.10

### Improvements & Fixes

- Confirmed the Tizen 6.0 minimum for plugins after Tizen 5.5 service-runtime testing; retained the existing Tizen 5.x plugin and synchronization block while preserving EngineFS torrent support (@WhiteGiso)
- Kept the production PluginService transport with certificate verification and excluded experimental Tizen 5.5 bundling and network adaptations (@WhiteGiso)
- Refresh addon catalog responses after manual synchronization, including failed sync attempts, matching Android's refresh behavior (@WhiteGiso)
- Isolated catalog cache entries by addon URL and prevented in-flight responses from repopulating invalidated cache entries (@WhiteGiso)

## 1.0.9

### Improvements & Fixes

- Improved HLS request budgets, buffering and webOS playback recovery, and reduced transient stall log noise (@WhiteGiso)
- Fixed next-episode overlay focus and extended next-episode source resolution time (@WhiteGiso)
- Improved Home image hydration efficiency, hero overflow and Library Discover navigation (@WhiteGiso)
- Expanded directional remote key normalization and added a webOS service path for TMDB lookups (@WhiteGiso)
- Reconciled verified empty cloud plugin snapshots while preserving dirty local state, restricted plugin HTTP access to loopback clients and aligned provider request timeouts (@WhiteGiso)

## 1.0.8

### Improvements & Fixes

- Restored animated Home focus transitions and spring scrolling on modern webOS while retaining constrained-runtime safeguards (@WhiteGiso)
- Fixed progressive Home catalog rendering and visible poster hydration so lower rows and artwork no longer arrive late during D-pad navigation (@WhiteGiso)
- Prevented an unavailable optional webOS PluginService from blocking watched items, watch progress, and Continue Watching refreshes (@WhiteGiso)
- Decoded escaped Android newline sequences when importing localized strings (@WhiteGiso)

## 1.0.7

### Improvements & Fixes

- Disabled executable plugins and plugin pull/push synchronization on Samsung Tizen 4.x and 5.x while preserving the supported EngineFS/P2P path, and documented the platform limits (@WhiteGiso)
- Standardized the supported Tizen 6+ service pipeline with fixed service ports, canonical WGT packaging, strict health readiness, watchdog recovery, and actionable plugin diagnostics (@WhiteGiso)
- Unified the webOS media and plugin companion layout and hardened Smart TV service, playback, subtitle, navigation, and remote-request handling (@WhiteGiso)
- Improved profile-scoped plugin and watched-state synchronization with provider identity matching and local-state preservation when tracking services fail (@WhiteGiso)
- Removed obsolete Tizen compatibility bridges, legacy service definitions, and unused repository/store-submission assets (@WhiteGiso)

## 1.0.6

### Improvements & Fixes

- Aligned Smart TV playback with Android TV, including post-play recommendations, next-episode and trailer playback, TMDB/Trakt/MDBList metadata, player preferences, subtitle positioning, localized UI, and richer Tizen/webOS diagnostics (@WhiteGiso)
- Stabilized plugin execution and playback across Tizen and webOS, with safer companion-service handling, proxy fallbacks, provider actions, profile synchronization, and reliable Plugins-screen D-pad focus (@WhiteGiso)
- Improved Smart TV navigation and startup responsiveness by rendering Home, Library, Search, Discover, Catalogs, Collections, Detail, Settings, QR login, and TMDB routes before remote work completes while preserving focus and Back behavior (@WhiteGiso)
- Preserved library and watched state across profiles and remote synchronization, including safe empty addon snapshots, Trakt watched movies, cross-provider title identity matching, and consistent native search navigation (@WhiteGiso)
- Made startup update detection reliable on slow Tizen boots with route coordination and transient-request retries, and corrected the README release links for installer, Tizen WGT, and webOS downloads (@WhiteGiso)

## 1.0.5

### Improvements & Fixes

- Aligned Smart TV plugin execution and stream searching with Android TV, including exception containment, provider scheduling, shared sessions, profile synchronization, and pause/resume lifecycle (@WhiteGiso)
- Kept Tizen EngineFS and PluginService independent, on-demand, and separately packaged for direct installation and Apps2Samsung while preserving their distinct ports and identifiers (@WhiteGiso)
- Added runtime notices and translations for TVs where plugin execution is unsupported or limited, without adding messages on fully supported runtimes (@WhiteGiso)
- Hardened TV input/navigation and Tizen/WebOS service handling while retaining warnings and errors for real failures only (@WhiteGiso)

## 1.0.4

### Improvements & Fixes

- Hardened Continue Watching, library loading, and remote progress state so profile changes and delayed synchronization do not replace valid TV content with a temporary empty view (@WhiteGiso)
- Aligned plugin execution with Android behavior by preserving eligible provider work in a cancellable queue and isolating legacy plugin data and migrations per profile (@WhiteGiso)
- Improved Home hero metadata and artwork transitions, Tizen live HLS fallback, and Library/Plugins focus restoration for Samsung TV navigation (@WhiteGiso)
- Aligned plugin synchronization with Android by pulling the remote snapshot before any pending push, so opaque legacy rows cannot block classification and provider hydration (@WhiteGiso)
- Added independent Tizen EngineFS and PluginService lifecycles and ports, preserving lazy P2P startup and starting PluginService on demand during plugin synchronization or the first plugin request, with runtime diagnostics and duplicate-port handling (@WhiteGiso)
- Strengthened Tizen WGT packaging and Samsung installer validation so both service files, bridge, and manifest declarations are checked before installation (@WhiteGiso)

## 1.0.3

- Preserved profile-bound local repository changes during remote reconciliation so stale snapshots cannot overwrite recent TV updates (@WhiteGiso)
- Moved provider-code caching from synchronous `localStorage` to profile-keyed asynchronous IndexedDB with bounded eviction, memory fallback, cleanup handling, authentication/profile integration, and the required Tizen storage privilege (@WhiteGiso)
- Restored the existing detail route after playback, targeting the correct history entry and avoiding duplicate detail screens while retaining stream cleanup (@WhiteGiso)
- Removed test programs and plugin fixtures from tracked application directories, keeping local test assets exclusively under the ignored root `tests/` directory (@WhiteGiso)
